# Write a Data Science Blog Post
Repository for first project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - an analysis of Spotify tracks in the GB market.

## Installation
There are no requirements for additional packages that are not installed on the Anadonda distribution. The code was run on Python version 3.8.5.

## Project Motivation
This is the first project submission for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.
In the project, we looked at Spotify music tracks released on the Great Britain market.  The data contains details of around 100k tracks released between 1922 and 2021.  We were interested in the following questions:
* Who are the most popular artists and what are the most popular tracks on Spotify for the GB market?
* How did various audio features change over time?
* What contributes to song popularity, and can we predict a song's popularity?

## File Descriptions
There is a single Jupyter notebook provided.  The notebook imports and cleans the dataset, then goes on to perform analysis to answer the questions listed above.  I have used comments and markdown cells to help make the steps easier to follow.

## Results
The results of the analysis can be found at my [Medium blog post]().

The data was obtained from the Spotify Web API and published to Kaggle by [Yamac Eren Ay](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay). The dataset and further information about it can be found on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-tracks-dataset-19222021?select=GB.csv) (note that the full dataset contains data for all Spotify markets, and our analysis only covered the Great Britain market).
